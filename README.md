# MerkleTrie-ZKP

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a zero-knowledge proof protocol using ZoKrates. The protocol allows a user to prove that they know the initial data required to construct a Merkle trie without revealing the data itself. This protocol is integrated with a smart contract written in Solidity. The project also includes analysis tools for working with zero-knowledge proof contracts and tests written in Ruby.

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Protocol**: Implemented in ZoKrates to prove knowledge of data for constructing a Merkle trie.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: The protocol is called and verified through a Solidity smart contract.
- **Analysis Tools**: Tools to analyze and work with zero-knowledge proof contracts.
- **Testing Suite**: Tests for the contract written in Ruby to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Project Structure

- **`merkle_tree_project/`**: Contains the ZoKrates implementation for the zero-knowledge proof.
- **`Scontract.sol`**: Solidity smart contract to interact with the ZoKrates protocol.
- **`verifier.sol`**: Auto-generated verifier contract from ZoKrates.
- **`proof.json`**: Example proof generated by ZoKrates.
- **`verification_key.json`**: Verification key for the proof.
- **`main.zok`**: Main ZoKrates file containing the logic for the zero-knowledge proof.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **ZoKrates**: Ensure you have ZoKrates installed. Follow the instructions on the [ZoKrates documentation](https://zokrates.github.io/gettingstarted.html).
- **Solidity**: You'll need a Solidity development environment. Consider using Truffle or Hardhat.
- **Ruby**: Required for running the test suite. Make sure you have Ruby installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YBarsukova/MerkleTrie-ZKP.git
    cd MerkleTrie-ZKP
    ```

2. **Setup ZoKrates**:
   Follow the [ZoKrates setup guide](https://zokrates.github.io/gettingstarted.html) to install and configure ZoKrates.

3. **Compile the ZoKrates Code**:
    ```bash
    zokrates compile -i merkle_tree_project/main.zok
    ```

4. **Generate Proof and Verification Key**:
    ```bash
    zokrates setup
    zokrates compute-witness -a <inputs>
    zokrates generate-proof
    zokrates export-verifier
    ```

5. **Deploy Smart Contract**:
   Use your preferred Solidity development environment to deploy `Scontract.sol` and `verifier.sol`.

## Usage

1. Generate a proof using ZoKrates with the known data.
2. Deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain.
3. Call the smart contract with the generated proof to verify the knowledge of the data without revealing it.
